# 1. Pull Requests Rules

## 1.1 For Developers

1. All PRs should be as small as possible
2. Write useful descriptions and titles
3. Respect this [rules](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-message-header) for commits
4. Add comments on your pull request to help guide the reviewer
5. Add some screenshots for your front-end changes
6. Always work on a dedicated branch, but try not to have things that depend on each other in different branches that are not merged in *dev* yet

## 1.2 For Reviewers

1. Integrate quickly (at least once a day)
2. Test the PR on local machine before merging it into *dev*
3. Give clear comments for PR rejection if things don't work as expected
